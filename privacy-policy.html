        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to SmartNoteAI, an application developed by Cybrainx ("we", "us", or "our"). We deeply respect your
            privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you as to how we
            look after your personal data when you visit our website or use our application.</p>

        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>SmartNoteAI is designed with local-first processing principles. The majority of your notes, voice memos, and
            tags are stored directly on your device. However, to provide our core AI features, certain information may
            be processed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audio and Text Data:</strong> When using the "AI Analyze" feature, your audio memos or textual
                web links are securely transmitted to our AI processors (or directly to providers like Google Gemini)
                solely for the purpose of generating transcriptions, summaries, and tags.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous analytics regarding app crashes and general
                feature usage to improve application stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We use your data strictly to execute the functionality of the App. Your audio and text are processed in
            real-time by artificial intelligence models and are <strong>not</strong> permanently stored on our servers
            after the processing is complete.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.
            This does not include trusted third parties (such as AI model providers) who assist us in operating our
            application, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since your notes are stored locally on your device, you have complete control over them. You can delete your
            data at any time by deleting the notes within the app or uninstalling the application entirely.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a
                href="mailto:owner@cybrainx.com" style="color: var(--primary);">owner@cybrainx.com</a></p>
